# SPEECH to TEXT

### PROBLEM STAEMENT
In this project our goal is to acheive the problem of converting audio data into textual data.

### DESCRIPTION OVERVIEW
Speech Recognition is an important feature in several applications used such as home automation, artificial intelligence, etc. This article aims to provide an introduction on how to make use of the Speech Recognition library of Python. This is useful as it can be used on microcontrollers such as Raspberri Pis with the help of an external microphone.

Speech recognition technologies such as Alexa, Cortana, Google Assistant and Siri are changing the way people interact with their devices, homes, cars, and jobs. The technology allows us to talk to a computer or device that interprets what we‚Äôre saying in order to respond to our question or command.

Popular digital assistants, include:
‚Ä¢	Amazon‚Äôs Alexa
‚Ä¢	Apple‚Äôs Siri
‚Ä¢	Google‚Äôs Google Assistant
‚Ä¢	Microsoft‚Äôs Cortana

### TECHNOLOGY USE
Here we will be using  Anaconda Python 3.6 and SpeechRecognition package.

### INSTALLATION
